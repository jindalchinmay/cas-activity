cas global reflection writer

- need to use agentic framework to make this better
- given a template, the agent should be able to go to links on it's own, scrape the data, and find relevant answers to the question
- instead of scraping all of the website and giving it directly in the context window of the LLM
- for example, if it needs to find facts, it should be able to go through the listed links and then find the relevant facts and then source them
- or it should just be able to web crawl and search things automatically in the first place

i want this to be able to take some context for my cas activity and then given a template can produce global reflections with relevant links and sources
- needs to be able to crawl things on its own or given a list of links, go through the links automatically and then pick where to find the information from
